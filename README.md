This project is still a work in progress and the final file structure and code is not complete

The worldwide hair care industry is currently a 90 billion dollar industry (https://www.statista.com/statistics/254608/global-hair-care-market-size/). Consumers want to know which products work best for their hair type. With each manufacturer vying for the consumers seperate atention it is hard to know which products will actually work for their hair. One can read reviews but everyone's hair is a little different from ones own. Even if the hair looks the same it can have different properties that affect how products work with the hair. What works for someone doesn't necessarly work for someone elses. THe Curly Girl Method is a way of caring for hair that is silcone, paraban, waxe, and drying alcohols free. It focuses on curly hair which is often more suseptible to certain problems, but there are benefits to be gained from using the method despite the hair curl pattern. At its core Curly Girl Method (CGM or CG) is a way of keeping ones natural hair at its healthiest.

The point of this project is to scrape signatures off of the www.Naturalycurly.com website's forum. Most people's signature contains their hair type and the products they use as wel as potentially their method of doing their hair. One the signatures are gathered and cleaned, Natural Langauge Processing techniques are applied to the useful signatures in order to extract insights on type of products and techniques most used by a person with a similar hair type to the user. This will be built out into a web app with a user quiz and product reccomendations for their hair catagories.

* Curl Pattern: Insert image of curl patterns here
* Porosity: The propensity  of hair to soak up and hold water
* Strand Thickness: individual hair diameter
* Hair Density: Number of hairs per area of scalp


This project uses Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
The final technical and non-technical notebooks as well as the accompanying power point and web app can be found in the results folder. Functions used in the process of making and cleaning the data can be found in the src folder.
